            <p>One of the most memorable trips I have ever taken was 2 years ago when my wife and I went 
            to Santorini, Greece. We spent 4 days and 3 nights on the island exploring the beautiful caldera, trying 
            out Greek food, and experiencing the breath taking views that Santorini has to offer.

            Here is a list of my 3 favorite pet names:
            <ul>
                <li>Cat1</li>
                <li>Cat2</li>
            </ul>
