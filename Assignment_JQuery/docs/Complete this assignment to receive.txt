Create a JavaScript class called GalleryItem to represent works of art.  Use the function technique for creating the class.

The data members should be:

name
price
thumbnail image
large image
Create an array of (5) GalleryItem instances

On the page, create three areas using div's

A space to display a (horizontal) row of (5) thumbnail images that represent each work of art in the gallery.
An area to show a larger image of a work of art
An area to display related information - you may place this 3rd area wherever you want
Using jQuery, do the following:

Populate the top div with the display of 5 thumbnails when the page loads
When the user hovers over a thumbnail, display the corresponding large image in the space for the large image - best if the image fades in over 1-2 seconds
When the user clicks on a thumbnail, display the panel of information that corresponds to that work of art (name, price).  Hide that panel after 4 seconds.
