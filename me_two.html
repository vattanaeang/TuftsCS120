    <h1>Vattana Eang</h1>
    <p>One of the most memorable trips I have ever taken was 2 years ago when my wife and I went
        to Santorini, Greece. We spent 4 days and 3 nights on the island exploring the beautiful caldera, trying
        out Greek food, and experiencing the breath taking views that Santorini has to offer.

        <li>A dog named Noodle</li>
        <li>A chicken named Beyonce</li>
    </ul>

            Spain Restaurant
        </a> locates in Cranston, RI. It serves Spanish and Mediterranean inspired cuisine. It is my favorite restaurant
        because the food is amazing, the service is exceptional and the restaurent is calm and quiet.
        Most importantly, the price is also reasonable.

                I really love this house special called filet mignon served with pasta. The filet mignon was soft and
                tasted very delicious when it is served medium. I enjoy it with a little bit of black pepper and
                which adds a rich and savory flavor. Sometimes, I like to mix a bit of grated Parmesan into the pasta
                for extra flavor.
